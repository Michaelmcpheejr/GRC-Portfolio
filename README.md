## Horizon Valley Medical Center – Internal Security Audit ##

**Engagement Type**: Internal Audit  
**Industry**: Healthcare  
**Frameworks**: NIST CSF, HIPAA, SOC 2  
**Role**: Lead Auditor

** Scenario **  
Horizon Valley Medical Center needed to conduct an internal cybersecurity audit after experiencing a phishing attack that compromised multiple employee email accounts and patient records. While no patient data was confirmed leaked, the incident revealed gaps in their cybersecurity readiness, particularly regarding response protocols, regulatory compliance, and business continuity planning. Hospital leadership expressed concern over their lack of a structured security framework and recognized the need for an objective, comprehensive review of their digital environment.

To address these concerns, I was tasked with executing a detailed internal audit focused on identifying and mitigating potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to the hospital’s critical assets. This including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), infrastructure systems, and user access controls. This engagement aligned with the hospital’s goal to strengthen its overall security posture, enhance HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance, and establish a roadmap for resilient, sustainable cybersecurity operations. My approach was structured using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and relevant NIST Special Publications to ensure the audit was standards-driven, actionable, and tailored to healthcare-specific risks.
